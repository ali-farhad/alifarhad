I welcome you all to my new blog. This blog is hosted on `jekyll` which is a really cool CMS-less blog system designed for people like me. I will try to keep things updated, and share articles that bring value and quality to you. My aim with this blog is to have my presense on the World Wide web in a decent form that is as visually appealing as it is accessible.  

I will also be sharing my coding jounrey as I embark on untested waters and learn exciting new things mostly related to existing softwares, and coding new ones.

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] if you want to know more about Jekyll. However, if you have any queries related to my site, you may contact me directly at my email address @ `alifarhad557@gmail.com`
